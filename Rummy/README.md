The Objective of the Game:
    The objective is to form Sequences and Sets (or triads). And when a player has formed required sequences and triads using all the 13 card, the player declares his/her turn. A valid declare must have 1 sequence of length 4 and 3 groups of 3 cards which can be sequence or triad.
A Sequence:
    A Sequence consists of 3 or 4 of same suit and are in consecutive order. The valid order being A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K. Thus with ace you can form the run A-2-3 but you can not form Q-K-A or K-A-2. Examples of valid runs are 4H-5H-6H , 9D-10D-JD, 9S-10S-JS-QS, AC-2C-3C-4C and 8H-9H-10H-JH.
Triad:
    When playing with three 52-card decks, the three cards of same rank and same suit are treated as pure Triad. For example:  9C-9D-9S and JH-JC-JD. 
A Valid Declare:
    The player who is first to use all the 13 cards to form sequnces and triads that also meet the basic requirement of 1 lenght 4 sequence wins.
